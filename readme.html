There are three major changes from this code and the original wordpress code
The first can be found within the wp-config.php -> line 23 - 32
Here is where the connections to the database are listed, this is by far not best practice and needs to be hid using a .ignore file but is left in for the sake showcasing development.

the second can be found within wp-content -> themes -> twentyeleven -> custom.css
This file is here to contain the custom css that I wanted applied to the theme.

the third change can be found within wp-content -> themes -> twentyeleven -> functions.php -> line 298 & 302
the first line a way in which wordpress can handle the variant css file and the second line is displaying the file on the website at the end of the queue system
